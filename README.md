# Body Maps of Love
This repository contains analysis code for the Body Maps of Love -project.

Unfortunately, due to ethical restrictions, we cannot share the individual level data. Thus, most of the results of the manuscript can't be reproduced directly using the files available in this repository. However, from the code, one can review how the results of the manuscript were produced. 

Ethical restrictions do not apply to group-level data, and they are made available in the files: ---. ---. and bspm_ttest.mat. These can be used to reproduce, for example, the clustering analyses and the Figures 1, 3 and 4 of the manuscripts. If you are interested in comparisons to previous studies, the (group-level) body maps can be found from the bspm_ttest.mat -file.

Most of the code used here was repurposed from a previous project (https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/eglerean/sensations/-/tree/master/) following MIT license. Thus, if you reuse the code (except files ---), please cite:
